## Introduction

In the world of web development, rendering techniques play a crucial role in how efficiently applications deliver content to users. This repository dives deep into the performance aspects of these techniques, providing insights that can help developers choose the best approach for their applications.

## Background

React has transformed the way developers build user interfaces. However, choosing the right rendering technique can significantly impact performance and user experience. This project examines the strengths and weaknesses of various rendering methods, allowing developers to make informed decisions.

## Rendering Techniques

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

CSR is a method where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and uses JavaScript to render the content. This technique can lead to faster interactions once the page is loaded, but initial load times can be longer.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR renders the content on the server and sends a fully rendered page to the client. This can improve initial load times and SEO but may lead to slower interactions after the page is loaded.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG pre-renders pages at build time. This results in fast load times and excellent SEO. However, it lacks the flexibility of CSR and SSR when it comes to dynamic content.

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

ISR allows developers to update static content without rebuilding the entire site. This offers a balance between static and dynamic rendering, making it suitable for many applications.

### Partial Server-Side Rendering (PSSR)

PSSR combines elements of CSR and SSR. It allows certain parts of a page to be rendered on the server while others are rendered on the client, optimizing performance.

### React Server Components (RSC)

RSC is a new experimental feature that allows developers to build components that render on the server without sending their code to the client. This can lead to improved performance and reduced bundle sizes.

## Performance Testing

Performance testing is essential to understand how different rendering techniques affect user experience. This repository includes various performance tests that measure load times, interaction speeds, and overall efficiency. 

We use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and custom benchmarks to gather data and analyze results.
